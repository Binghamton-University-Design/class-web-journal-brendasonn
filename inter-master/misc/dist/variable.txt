There are three flavors of variable Inter to choose from:

- Inter (Variable)
  Multi-axis complete family called "Inter"

- Inter V (Variable)
  Multi-axis complete family called "Inter V"
  Apart from the difference in family name, this is the same as the above.
  Useful when you want to install traditional constant font files alongside
  the variable version.

- Inter (Variable, single axis)
  Single-axis variable fonts. Only the weight is variable, but not the slant.
  These font files are provided only for technical compatibility with systems
  that do not support mult-axis variable fonts.

Note: Variable fonts is a new technology still undergoing development.
      System and application support is emerging but is not perfect.

The "Inter (Web)" directory contains WOFF2 files of both the multi-axis and
single-axis variable font files.

If you're in doubt or uncertain about variable fonts, then you probably don't
need to use a variable font. Install the fonts in the "Inter" folder instead.
