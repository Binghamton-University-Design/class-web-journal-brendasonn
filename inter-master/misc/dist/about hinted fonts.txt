Inter font files comes in two versions: without TrueType hints
and "hinted"; with TrueType hints.

The folder called "Inter (Hinted, for Windows)" contains font files with
ClearType hints. All other folders contains font files without hints.

What are hints?


The TrueType hints are used by ClearType on Windows machines where ClearType
is enabled. This usually changes the appearance of the fonts and can in some
cases increase the legibility of text.

Additionally, hints are little computer programs that takes up considerable
disk space, meaning that font files with hints are larger than those without
hints. This might be a consideration when using web fonts.

The hints for Inter are automatically generated by a program called autohint.
