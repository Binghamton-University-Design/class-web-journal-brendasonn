Installing traditional static/constant font files on macOS:

1. Copy the "Inter" folder
2. Press cmd-shift-G in Finder
3. Enter "~/Library/Fonts" into the dialog that shows up and press RETURN.
4. Delete any existing "Inter" files and folders
5. Paste the "Inter" folder


Installing variable font on macOS:

1. Copy the "Inter.otf" file in the "Inter (Variable)" folder
2. Press cmd-shift-G in Finder
3. Enter "~/Library/Fonts" into the dialog that shows up and press RETURN.
4. Delete any existing "Inter" files and folders
5. Paste the "Inter.otf" file

Note that you can install both the traditional static fonts AND variable fonts
alongside each other: Use the "Inter" and "Inter V (Variable)" folders.
The "Inter V (Variable)" folder contains Inter named "Inter V", avoiding name
conflicts.

Having issues? Are you using an older version of macOS (older than 10.13)?
Then you'll want to install the non-variable fonts (top of this document.)
